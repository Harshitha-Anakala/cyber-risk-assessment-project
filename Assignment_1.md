This assignment performs initial threat intelligence analysis on MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise dataset.

##What does this Program do
- This program takes the dtaset and extracts only attack techniques. The threat scoring function      assigns risk scores based on the keywords (credential theft,privilege        escalation,remote             access,stelth behavior). All techniques are sorted and top 10 risk threats are identified. At       last, techniques with scores greater than      8.9 are taken as critical threats to prioritize           security focus.

How does your scoring system help a cybersecurity analyst prioritize threats?
- The scoring system gives a numerical risk value to each attack technique based on the high risk keywords. By ranking techniques based on their calculated threat score, it       allows cybersecurity analysts to quickly identify the attack patterns. This helps analysts get their attention on critical threats first and working on risk management.
