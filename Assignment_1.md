##What does this Program do
- This program takes the dtaset and extracts only attack techniques. The threat scoring function      assigns risk scores based on the keywords (credential theft,privilege escalation,remote             access,stelth behavior). All techniques are sorted and top 10 risk threats are identified. At       last, techniques with scores greater than 8.9 are taken as critical threats to prioritize           security focus.
